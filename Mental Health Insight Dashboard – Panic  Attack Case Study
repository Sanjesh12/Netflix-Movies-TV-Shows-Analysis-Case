# Mental Health Insight Dashboard – Panic Attack Case Study

## Project Overview

This project explores the patterns and causes of panic attacks using a dataset of 1,200 respondents and 23 variables. The analysis aims to uncover how demographics, lifestyle habits, and therapy choices relate to the frequency and severity of panic attacks.  
All insights are visualized through a Power BI dashboard, divided into three meaningful sections for clarity and actionability.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: Interactive data visualization
- **Microsoft Excel**: Basic data cleaning
- **Dataset**: 1,200 rows × 23 columns

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to identify:

- Which age groups are most affected by panic attacks
- The most common triggers behind panic attacks
- Time patterns of occurrences (e.g., day vs. night, weekdays vs. weekends)
- The impact of lifestyle habits such as alcohol, caffeine, and social media use

These insights aim to raise awareness about mental health patterns and promote healthier lifestyle decisions.

## Data Cleaning Process

- **Removed Duplicates:** Ensured each entry represents a unique individual.
- **Handled Missing Values:** Filled missing values using mean/median for numerical data, mode/"Unknown" for categorical data.
- **Standardized Categorical Values:** Unified inconsistent entries and binary responses.
- **Created 'Age Group' Feature:** Segmented ages into Children, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, Middle Adult, and Seniors.
- **Converted Data Types:** Ensured correct numerical and categorical formats.
- **Removed Irrelevant Columns:** Dropped columns with too many missing values or not useful for analysis.

## Dashboard Structure & Key Insights

### 1. Overview & Demographics

- **Panic Attack Frequency by Age Group:**  
  Middle-aged adults (45–64) report the highest frequency. Young adults and adults follow with slightly lower rates.
- **Gender Distribution:**  
  Near-equal distribution between males and females; 114 non-binary participants.
- **Top Triggers:**  
  PTSD, phobia, caffeine, social anxiety, and stress are most common.
- **Panic Attack Frequency by Trigger and Gender:**  
  PTSD, caffeine, and social anxiety triggers are high across all genders.

### 2. Lifestyle & Behavioral Patterns

- **Average Panic Score by Sleep Hours:**  
  Lowest scores with 4–5 hours of sleep, peaking at 6 hours, then dropping after 7 hours.
- **Caffeine Intake vs Panic Score:**  
  Panic score peaks at 3 cups/day, suggesting a threshold effect.
- **Exercise Frequency vs Panic Score:**  
  Moderate exercise reduces panic; over-exercising may be counterproductive.
- **Alcohol Consumption vs Panic Frequency:**  
  Heavy drinkers with PTSD or caffeine triggers report the highest panic frequencies.

### 3. Symptoms & Therapy

- **Panic Attack Frequency by Medical History:**  
  Anxiety, depression, and PTSD histories are most common among frequent cases.
- **Therapy Participation:**  
  Nearly even split between participants who have and haven’t taken therapy.
- **Average Panic Score by Therapy & Medication:**  
  Therapy is beneficial for anxiety/depression but less so for PTSD; some without medical history still report high scores after therapy.

## Conclusion

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of how real-world data reveals critical insights about mental health.  
Dividing the dashboard into logical sections made it possible to extract meaningful trends on demographics, lifestyle, and therapy.  
Key learnings include the clear links between poor sleep, high caffeine intake, and panic scores, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression among those affected.  
Building this Power BI dashboard enhanced my data visualization skills and allowed me to contribute to spreading awareness about mental health.
